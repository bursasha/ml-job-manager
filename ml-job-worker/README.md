# ML Job Worker

**Celery‐based Worker** for executing ML jobs (Data Preprocessing & Active ML). 
Built with `Celery`, `TensorFlow`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Astropy` and `HTTPX`.

---

## Overview

The **ML Job Worker** runs two types of background jobs, triggered by the **ML Job API**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   – Reads FITS spectra, interpolates flux onto a uniform grid, scales & writes an `HDF5`.  
   – Reports completion/failure back to the API.

2. **Active ML**  
   – Iteratively trains a 1D-CNN on preprocessed data, selects oracle/performance/candidate sets.  
   – Writes `HDF5` and `JSON` outputs for each iteration.  
   – Initializes batch “labelling” records via the API and signals job end.

All shared files (raw spectra, configs, results, logs) live on a host-mounted filesystem.

## Features

- `Celery 5` Worker with `AMQP` broker (`RabbitMQ`).  
- `Pydantic` settings + DTOs for config validation.  
- `TensorFlow 2.16` + `Keras` CNN for spectrum classification.  
- `Scikit-Learn` (SMOTE, t-SNE), `SciPy`, `NumPy`, `Astropy`.  
- `HTTPX` client to notify **ML Job API** of job progress and initialize labellings.  
- Robust error handling and automatic retry on broker connectivity.
