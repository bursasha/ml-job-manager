# üõ†Ô∏è ML Job Worker

**Celery‚Äêbased Worker** for executing ML jobs (Data Preprocessing & Active ML). 

Built with `Celery`, `TensorFlow`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Astropy` and `HTTPX`.

---

## üîç Overview

The **ML Job Worker** runs two types of background jobs, triggered by the **ML Job API**:


1. **Data Preprocessing**  

   ‚Äì Reads FITS spectra, interpolates flux onto a uniform grid, scales & writes an `HDF5`.  
   
   ‚Äì Reports completion/failure back to the API.


2. **Active ML**  
   
   ‚Äì Iteratively trains a 1D-CNN on preprocessed data, selects oracle/performance/candidate sets.  
   
   ‚Äì Writes `HDF5` and `JSON` outputs for each iteration.  
   
   ‚Äì Initializes batch ‚Äúlabelling‚Äù records via the **ML Job API** and signals job end.


All shared files (raw spectra, configs, results, logs) live on a host-mounted filesystem.

## üìç Features

- `Celery 5.5` Worker receives jobs from `AMQP` `RabbitMQ` broker - **ML Job Queue.**  

- `Pydantic` settings + DTOs for config validation.  

- `TensorFlow 2.16` + `Keras` CNN for spectrum classification.  

- `Scikit-Learn` (SMOTE, t-SNE), `SciPy`, `NumPy`, `Astropy`.  

- `HTTPX` client to notify **ML Job API** of job progress and initialize labellings.  

- Robust error handling and automatic retry on broker connectivity.
